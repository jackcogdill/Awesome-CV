\begin{cvletter}

Airbnb was one of the first companies I understood to be a startup. I first found out about it when my mom suggested we use it with some friends traveling to a convention, so all seven of us stayed in a well furnished basement for really cheap. After that, every time I traveled somewhere I excitedly wondered what kind of new house I would be staying at with Airbnb. Now as I am looking for an internship with my passion of Computer Science, I could not be more excited for the opportunity to work for Airbnb.

I love creating user-friendly products and interfaces, always trying to give the user the best possible experience. For example, when interning this past summer at Faithlife (refer to attached resume), I worked with designers to ensure new features I helped create would give both a fresh and attractive experience to users while staying consistent with the rest of their application. One example was making an upwards expanding input box (similar to Facebook messenger) for a new AI assistant component for their application. I would love to contribute to any new projects Airbnb is working on, both backend and interface.

I would love to have the opportunity to interview for a position as a software engineer at Airbnb. I am glad to provide any additional information as needed and look forward to hearing back.
Thank you for your consideration.
