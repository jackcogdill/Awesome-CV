\begin{cvletter}

Airbnb was one of the first companies I understood to be a startup. I first found out about it when my mom suggested we use it with some friends traveling to a convention, so all seven of us stayed in a well furnished basement for really cheap. After that, every time I traveled somewhere I excitdely wondered what kind of new house I would be staying at with Airbnb. Now as I am looking for an internship with my passion of Computer Science, I could not be more excited for the opportunity to work for Airbnb.

Opening paragraph: State why you are writing; how you learned of the organization or position, and basic information about yourself.

2nd paragraph: Tell why you are interested in the employer or type of work the employer does (Simply stating that you are interested does not tell why, and can sound like a form letter). Demonstrate that you know enough about the employer or position to relate your background to the employer or position. Mention specific qualifications which make you a good fit for the employer’s needs. (Focus on what you can do for the employer, not what the employer can do for you.) This is an opportunity to explain in more detail relevant items in your resume. Refer to the fact that your resume is enclosed. Mention other enclosures if such are required to apply for a position.

3rd paragraph: Indicate that you would like the opportunity to interview for a position or to talk with the employer to learn more about their opportunities or hiring plans. State what you will do to follow up, such as telephone the employer within two weeks. If you will be in the employer’s location and could offer to schedule a visit, indicate when. State that you would be glad to provide the employer with any additional information needed. Thank the employer for her/his consideration.
