%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}

This cover letter is a follow up after meeting with recruiters at the Virginia Tech Computer Science career fair. Since learning about Appian at an info session at Virginia Tech, I knew that I wanted to intern there. I absolutely love learning and building new platforms for people to use, especially if it allows them to share in the experience of learning. Letting users create something of their own or allowing them to learn in some way—and to enjoy doing so—is the best result of any product in my mind.

    I'm interested in working at Appian because I want to work on software that goes into production and that customers will get to use and enjoy; creating features directly for customers is my passion for programming in computer science. An example of past experience I have in this area is creating a website, Hack Attack, which allows players to challenge each other in one-on-one programming and security challenges designed to teach basic programming and security concepts (see Side Projects section in attached resume). Over ninety-five students actually used the site in a tournament at an event hosted by the club I'm a part of, Hackers at Virginia Tech.

I would be glad to receive an opportunity to interview and am willing to provide any extra necessary details. \\ Thank you very much for your consideration.
